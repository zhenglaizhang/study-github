## Workflow
- Repeatable
- Reviewable
- Git Flow
  - master + develop (+ hotfix + release + feature_n)
- GitHub Flow
  - Less complicated
  - master happens to be the default branch, and as production branch
  - Code -> Collaborate -> Ship
  - challenges:
    - security concerns
    - code reviews
    - automated testing 
    - others... 

## Continuous Integration
- the process of automating the build and testing of changes when a commit is pushed to a branch
- adhere to your team's quality standards
- Reduce context switching
- Improve consistency for testing
- Reduce bugs in production

## Continuous Delivery
- Production ready with every commit
- Flexible to release as often as you want
- Doesn't always translate to releasing new code every time

## Continuous Deployment
- Take continuous delivery one step further
- Automated in the background, no human intervention
